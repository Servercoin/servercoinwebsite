        <div class="small-text">
            The point of Server Coin is to make the price of cloud services cheaper by making it easier to make one. Now there are some potential issues, but there are solutions. Like, what if someone's server has bad customer service? You can give them a bad rating on a servercoinguard app. If it's before you use it you can check their server on a servercoinguard app. Since anyone can create a servercoinguard app it would be impossible to censor all of them, as that would require one entity owning all of them. Now, why use this instead of something like AWS? The reason that someone would use this instead of AWS is because it's supposed to be cheaper(Don't know for sure yet because no one has made a servercoin server yet, but you don't need much to make one.). But what about something like filecoin? The thing about that is that while it can work for files, it can't be used to host virtual machines. So that's why it should be used instead of filecoin. Also the requirements to make one of those are very high anyways.

        <div class="small-text">
            Phase 1: Spread the word of ServerCoin enough that it has many fans instead of just a few, many search results instead of just a few. Also add minor quality of life updates along the way. 
            Phase 2: Get ServerCoin listed on tracking platforms like coingecko and coinmarketcap, and on more exchanges.
